## **Overview of the Results of Sprint 1**

The initial development phase of the Onyx platform, a mobile-first online art auction system featuring secure escrow-based payments, reached completion. The development team established the core system architecture and implemented key Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features. These features comprised a user authentication module, an artwork upload interface, a real-time bidding engine, and escrow payment integration.

The platform enables artists to upload and manage artworks, define auction parameters, and monitor sales. Collectors are able to browse active auctions, place bids, and complete secure transactions. An administrator dashboard was also developed to facilitate auction oversight, user verification, and transaction monitoring.

Preliminary testing confirmed that the system met its fundamental objectives; however, several issues were identified. Interface inconsistencies across mobile and web platforms, minor latency during simultaneous bidding, and delays in high-resolution uploads were observed. To address these, the team plans to refine UI consistency following the Onyx design guide, optimize WebSocket communication with Redis caching, and implement asynchronous upload mechanisms in Sprint 2\.

## **Key Successes (What Went Well)**

Team collaboration was one of the major strengths during Sprint 1\. The Onyx team maintained effective and transparent communication through daily stand-up meetings, supported by tools such as ChatGPT and Discord, ensuring alignment between frontend, backend, and design tasks. This consistent interaction helped the team quickly resolve issues and maintain development momentum throughout the sprint.  
Using Figma for prototyping and GitHub for version control significantly streamlined the workflow, reducing redundant work and saving valuable development time. All core MVP components were successfully delivered within the sprint timeline, demonstrating strong coordination, accountability, and commitment among all members.  
Particularly, the successful implementation of the real-time bidding system and escrow payment integration marked a major milestone toward establishing a functional, secure, and trustworthy online art auction platform. These achievements not only laid the technical foundation for future releases but also reflected the team’s ability to transform architectural designs into tangible, working features within a tight development cycle.

## **Challenges Encountered (What Didn’t Go Well)**

Despite the team’s achievements, some challenges were encountered during this sprint. Merge conflicts arose due to simultaneous work on shared Git branches without consistent updates. UI inconsistency between platforms created design misalignment, and upload latency for high-resolution artwork images affected user experience. Additionally, limited mid-sprint testing caused some bugs to be identified late in the cycle.

As a result, these issues highlighted the need for improved workflow discipline, clearer version control practices, and earlier quality assurance checks within each sprint.

## **Improvement Plan (What Could Be Improved)**

In the next sprint, all bugs within the application will be fixed to ensure the system functions properly. Then, the design elements will be refined and aligned with the prototype defined in Figma to enhance user experience with greater consistency and professionalism. Additionally, user roles within the system will be clearly defined to support appropriate functionality and data access according to each user group’s responsibilities.

## **Conclusion**

Overall, Sprint 1 marked a major step in establishing the foundation for the Onyx platform. The sprint successfully delivered core functionality while uncovering valuable insights into both system architecture and teamwork efficiency. Lessons learned from this iteration will directly inform improvements in Sprint 2 particularly in refining performance, enhancing design coherence, and optimizing collaborative processes. These advancements will move Onyx closer to becoming a secure, transparent, and user-centered digital art auction ecosystem.
